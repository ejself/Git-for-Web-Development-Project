Stretch Questions

1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    Inline elements do not change layout of text and are incorporated to not change formatting, but block elements like <p> will change layout of text.

2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    Computed position value = fixed. For example, top/right/bottom/left properties of an element's block specify their offset from the source, which is relative and fixed. 

3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    inline-Block

4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    Block: div, p, header
    Inline: span, a, b
    Inline-Block: to my knowledge, there are none and you have to declare it in your css.
